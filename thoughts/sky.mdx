Building my personal website was initially just a seed in my garden of thoughts. But then I met the sky, who shared with me everything, rain or shine. 

Connected via an invisible string, the sky was always there wherever I went. With the sun to brighten up my day and the moon to guide me through the dark. Day by day, the seed started to grow. 

But then a typhoon came. String broke. I fell. 

Feet out, head up, nothing is the same anymore. 

The seed, inspired by you, I'm growing it. Not the best, but I will try harder. 

<blockquote>â€œReach for the moon. Even if you miss, you will land among the stars."</blockquote>

I reach my hands up,

everyday. 

Holding on to the little hope, to connect with the sky again, 

one day.
