Have you ever felt the kind of pain that shatters you like a glass? The one that squeezes your heart at the most unexpected timings? Or the one you hope you’ll never experience again? 

If life was a game, these pain are like the last stage boss - no matter how hard you try to kill it with your top level skills, it never dies. Only the truly powerful and determined players trump. 

How then do the average players fight the boss? I don’t know how, maybe by experience? by becoming stronger? by getting help from other players? But one day they eventually do.

One of my favourite saying was “When all else fails, time heals everything”. Just like how the players defeat the boss one day, one day we too will overcome the pain and learn to be happy again. If we were to plot a graph of pain against time, we will get one with a negative gradient. We just have to trust time. 

Recently, I started to question, what if time doesn’t heal? The answer I got from a wise guy has became my new favourite saying - not one I currently believe in, but one that got me pondering deeper. 

<blockquote>“If time doesn’t heal, time will help forget.”</blockquote>

The current question is, what if time is a hundred years?
