<h1>Tailwind CSS</h1>
<p>Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable CSS framework that allows us to rapidly build modern websites without leaving our HTML.The first time I came across Tailwind CSS, I decided to use it to build my personal website, and I instantly fell in love with it. Below, I will share with you 3 reasons why I love Tailwind CSS.</p>

<h1>1. Highly Customizable</h1>
<p>We can easily create unique designs for distinct parts of our website! Tailwind gives us the ability to apply different designs to different components. We can easily customize the color palettes and styling of our page using the tailwind.config.js file. Moreover, we can effortlessly build fully responsive interfaces with Tailwind’s state variants that allow us to style states such as hover and focus with utility classes. Additionally, with Tailwind’s breakpoint prefix, configuring our interfaces for different screen sizes becomes a breeze!</p>

<h1>2. Dark Mode</h1>
<p>Next, unlike other CSS frameworks, Tailwind has a ‘dark’ variant that lets us style our site differently when dark mode is enabled. This means that we can smoothly configure our site for both light and dark mode. I am a huge fan of dark mode, so bonus points for Tailwind CSS!</p>

<h1>3. Easy to learn</h1>
<p>Lastly, Tailwind CSS has a less steep learning curve compared to other CSS frameworks. We can even take the pressure of remembering class names off our mind, with the official Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension for Visual Studio Code, which provides features such as Autocomplete, Linting, Hover Previews and Syntax Highlighting. So if you are a beginner looking to pick up a CSS framework, Tailwind CSS is a great choice to start learning.</p>
