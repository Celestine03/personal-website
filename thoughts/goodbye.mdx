I believe that everyone enters our lives for a purpose, even the ones who eventually left. 

I am thankful for the ones who were in my life since the very beginning, the ones who stayed, and even the ones who left. Like a roll of dough, they have stretched and shaped me for who I am today. 

Sometimes I wonder, why do people have to leave? Maybe because they have somewhere else to go? Maybe because they’ve served their purpose? Maybe because they just weren’t meant to stay? And it’s now that I realise, it’s only when they leave, that it makes the impact harder, the lessons more unforgettable and the growth larger. 

To those who stayed, i really appreciate your presence, every second of your time and the precious laughters you brought into my life. Know that if there ever comes a time when you have to leave, it’s fine. I’ll forgive you as long as you’re happy and I hope you’ll travel to a better place. 

To those who left, no matter how far you go, I’ll keep you close in my heart, and you’ll stay there forever. I’ll look back every now and then, but I’ll be sure to move my feet forward. Spread your wings to a better place and I hope you too can live your best life soon. 

I was happy, therefore I feel.

I am grateful, therefore I remember.
